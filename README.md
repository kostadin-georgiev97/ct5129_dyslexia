## Abstract

Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting reading and language skills. It poses significant challenges for individuals and society. Accurate and early detection of dyslexia is crucial for effective intervention and support. This thesis is based on an existing study with a supplementary dataset of native Spanish-speaking participants. The base paper uses the Random Forest algorithm for the classification of dyslexic and control participants. The reported results are considered a benchmark for the experiments that are part of this study. One of the aims is to improve pre-processing techniques using methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN). Additionally, classic machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs) are explored. We propose a new fully-connected Neural Network model which achieved 89.3% Accuracy and 61.4% F1-Score. That is a 12.5% improvement in Accuracy and 19% improvement in F1-Score compared to the baseline model.
